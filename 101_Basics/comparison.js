// Comparisons 
// one of the most effecient comparisons is when we compare with similar data types they gave most probably accurate results.
// all of these gave mostly accurate answers either in true or false.
console.log(4 > 6)
console.log(6 < 75)
console.log(3 >= 2)
console.log(5 <= 7)
console.log(3 != 2)
console.log(4 == 3)

// JS, becomes headache when we do an comparisons between different data types.
// they just convert the data types and then check for condition.
console.log("3" < 6)
console.log(null > 7)
console.log(null >= 0)
console.log(undefined == 6)

// if we want the translator to check for equality and also not want to convert the data types then we use ===
console.log(null === 5)

// if you want to handle that disadvantage of JS profesionally then we use an TYPESCRIPT which provides
// strictness in comparisons means it will not convert the datatype and directly check or do an comparison
